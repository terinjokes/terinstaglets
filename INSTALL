Terin's Taglets - (Beta) Version: 0.1
======================================
Some taglets created to aid in the creation of documentation in CIS3020 projects.
======================================
HOW-TO INSTALL

1) Build the taglet classes.

    javac -classpath "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_16\lib\tools.jar" *.java

2) Copy the compiled class files to your tagletpath directory. I use
   "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_16\taglets\" but you are free to use any directory

3) When generating javadocs, be sure to include the taglets and the tagletpath on the
   commandline. For example:

            javadoc -taglet AssumptionsTaglet -taglet ConstaintsTaglet \
                    -taglet LicenseTaglet -taglet RelationshipsTaglet \
                    -tagletpath "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_16\taglets\" \
                     classname.java

   where the "\" at the end of the line means the command continues to the next line, and
   should be typed into the commandline as one continuous line.
